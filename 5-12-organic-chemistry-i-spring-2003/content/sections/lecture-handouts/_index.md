This section contains notes used to supplement the lectures for the course. Some lecture notes apply to multiple class sessions. The Readings column refers to relevant sections in the course textbook, L. G. Wade, Jr. Organic Chemistry, 5th ed. The first half of the lectures were given by Dr. Sarah Tabacco, while the second half of the lectures were given by Prof. Barbara Imperiali.
